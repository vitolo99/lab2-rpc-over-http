## Primary goal

In order to achieve the primary goal, I tried to build the code using gradelw following the documentation of the last practice. But when building the project, it starts building the client module, because of that the build fails because it requires code derived from a wsdl file published by the server side.

I searched online the way to apply the gradelw commands build and bootRun choosing the module of the proyect,  I opened two differents terminals and in the first one I executed the commands: "./gradlew :server:build" and "./gradlew :server:bootRun". Then when the server is already running,  in the second one: "./gradlew :client:build" and "./gradlew :client:bootRun".

Last step shows an error, because the server response is implemented whit the "TODO()" function that is used to made you remember that the part where it is use hasnÂ´t been correctly implemented yet. I replace that by a response, building a block harcoding the string "hola" in the translation element. In addition to that, I replaced the input of the client request by "hello" and by building the Server side and the client side again, I obtained the required answer (> Task :client:bootRun: Result of translating [hello] is [Hola]).
